# Password Generator Starter Code
Weekly Challenge 03

## Challenge Approach
In my GitHub Repo, I created several issues for myself that resemble the acceptance criteria. I will allow them to guide me through this challenge.

I will create feature branches along the way to document how i completed each issue.
* Note: I may put more than one issue into one branch

## Challenge Details

### User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

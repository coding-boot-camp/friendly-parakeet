## Description

This website was built to have a random password generator. The original refracted code included the HTML,CSS,README and JavaScript files. However it needed a filled out README and code the code to make the button generate a password was broken.

There are no requirments required to install as JavaScript is installed in all major web browsers.

To use this site first click on the button. Then you will be prompted on the top of your screen. There will be four prompts that will ask if you want upper case, lower case, special characters and numerical values.
